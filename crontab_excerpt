# notes about cron format:
# day_of_week goes from 0-6 (sunday-saturday).
# if you want all weekdays you could do 1-5 or 1,2,3,4,5
# hour goes from 0-23
# if you don't care about one of the fields, put on asterisk there
# example: 
# 7:30pm any month, any day_of_month, Monday,Thursday,Friday is written in crontab as:
# 30 19 * * 1,4,5 scriptname

# EDIT THE FOLLOWING LINE as desired and write the edited text to your crontab file which is opened by entering the command 'crontab -e'
<minute> <hour> <day_of_month> <month_of_year> <day_of_week> export DISPLAY=:0 && sudo -u <your_username> playlist_alarm
